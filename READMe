Q)Write a C++ program that creates a Calculator class. The class contains two variables of integer type. Design a constructor that accepts two values as parameter and set those values.  
•	Design four methods named Add (), Subtract (), multiply (), Division ( ) for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers.  


•	For addition and subtraction, two numbers should be positive. 
If any negative number is entered then throw an exception in respective methods. 
So design an exception handler (ArithmeticException) in Add () and Subtract () methods respectively to check whether any number is negative or not. 


•	For division and multiplication two numbers should not be zero. 
If zero is entered for any number then throw an exception in respective methods. 
So design an exception handler (ArithmeticException) in multiply () and Division () methods respectively to check whether any number is zero or not.
